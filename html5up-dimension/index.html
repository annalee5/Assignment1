							<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Thanks for wanting to know a little more about me!<br>
									My name is Anna and I am Melbourne born and bred, but I am of Chinese heritage. Before Covid stopped the world, I was a Marketing Manager for a hospitality group, of which I really loved doing because of my passion for food and wine. With plenty of unforeseen spare time up my sleeve due to the pandemic, I have been keeping myself busy reading (definitely want to learn more about Cosmology in particular), knitting (currently attempting a sweater), going for bike rides (damn you steep inclines!) and learning the basics of HTML/CSS. <br>
									My prior studies include a Bachelor of Commerce degree, majoring in Marketing.</p>
							<h2 class="major">Interest in I.T.</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p><b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</b></p>
										<p>My interest in IT has always been innate, having expressed my creativity via website design using Microsoft Frontpage when I was a young age. I was always interested in exploring further, however I never contemplated the possibility of studying IT when I finished High School, as it wasn’t really a career presented to females. After having some time on my hands this year, I started learning HTML/CSS basics and really found myself enjoying it. This sparked an idea to take my learning to a more formal setting, which is how I got into this course. I’m very excited to see what potential this can bring, both personally and professionally!</p>
									<p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b></p>
										<p>RMIT stood out to me as an internationally renowned institute, one that would have highly capable and dedicated teaching staff. I wanted to learn from the best. As I was unsure when the lockdown restrictions would ease up for hospitality (thus, returning back to work), I decided the online avenue would be best and RMIT had the best flexibility for my lifestyle.</p>
								<p><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b></p>
									<p>I hope to take my knowledge to the next level, to expand my understanding of the industry in general. At the moment, my understanding of IT is very broad, so I would love to explore further. I also expect to be fully supported by my tutors/lecturers and fellow classmates, as an online learning environment will always present challenges. Although I am unsure whether study is 100% right for me (I haven’t studied at university level for seven years!), I am very much enjoying it at the moment.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Role</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><a href="pd.pdf" target = blank>Position Description: Product Designer for ABC</a></p>
								<p><b>A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</b></p>
										<p><ul>
											<li>The position is a Product Designer (Or UX/UI Designer) for ABC Kids and Me applications. This role appeals to me due to its vast and various responsibilities, as well as being a creative position that centers around the structure and discipline of technology, whilst also working in a highly social and collaborative environment. I would enjoy all aspects of this role as it would mean being able to put on one of many ‘hats’ throughout the working week. No two days would be the same.</li>
											<li>I like that the role is both UI and UX focused, not one specifically over the other. I also would prefer to work on applications over websites, as I believe whilst applications have a smaller design space to work with, you have to be much more focused and efficient with your design. Every element needs a purpose (or three!).</li>
											<li>There is also a strong research element that requires a person who has excellent capabilities to ask the right questions, to be approachable and to draw the responses out of the audience, in a time efficient manner.</li>
											<li>The added desirability of this role is working with a nationally renowned company such as the ABC, and in particular ABC Kids. The creative design element for ABC Kids would be a lot of fun to work with!</li></p></ul>

								<p><b>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</b></p>
								<p>change</p> 
									<p>This position requires quite a substantial amount of skills and qualifications, including:<br></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Strong understanding of human centered design principles within a digital landscape.</li>
											<li>Experience in designing complex enterprise software solutions and understanding of audience experience. </li>
											<li>Graduate degree in Design Media preferred
											<li>Knowledge of design tools such as Invision, Sketch, Git, Photoshop, and Illustrator.
											<li>Ability to think outside the box with fresh and innovative ideas. Also having a wide scope of design ability due to working on varying design projects for varying audicens throughout your career.
											<li>Excellent research skills, including the ability to extract the necessary information from focus groups.
											<li>Ability to present visual and verbal ideas in a clear, concise and engaging manner, to a wide range of stakeholders. Ability to take constructive feedback and make necessary adjustments
											<li>Excellent problem solving skills.
											<li>Ability to collaborate with multiple stakeholders of varying positions within the company.</li></p></ul>

										<p><b>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</b></p>
											<p>My work background does cover a few of the skills required for this role. Specifically:<br></p>
											<ul>
												<li>An understanding of basic design principles, as well as proven experience working in an apparel design capacity. This includes understanding of market place, market segments and user’s needs. Strong attention to detail is required.</li>
												<li>Ability to translate data, user research and creative trend forecasts into actionable strategies and commercially viable products.</li>
												<li>Collaborating and communicating with multiple stakeholders of all levels and cross functional teams.</li>
												<li>Problem-solving skills and ability to handle pressure.</li>
												<li>Presentation skills including presenting findings, conceptual ideas, both visually and verbally. Also ability to present in an informative, inspirational and engaging manner.</li>
												<li>High written and spoken communication skills, including sound negotiation skills.</li><p></ul>

										<p><b>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.</b></p>
												<p>	Firstly, my enrolment in RMIT’s Bachelor of IT degree will help me greatly with the technical aspects of the role, specifically the programming and user centered design courses, which is currently the pathway I am more drawn towards.</p>
													<p>I will have to personally work towards graphic design skills and understanding of role specific programs such as Figma and Sketch, which are industry standard. I believe this will require a lot of dedicated hours to this, perhaps I will take up short courses on programs such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. My current knowledge of these Adobe programs are basic, so I would really need to step it up, and get comfortable using trackpads/pens and be comfortable with my ability to hand sketch ideas for prototyping.</p>
												<p>From there, an extensive design portfolio will be required to showcase the breath of creative abilities. This will include creating a lot of varying design work, including submissions to design hackathons, personal projects and (hopefully!) commercial work too.</p>
												<p>An indepth understanding of programming languages, such as Swift (iOs), Java and Kotlin (Android), Javascript or TypeScript (hybrid development) would be ideal in this role. However, a basic understanding of frontend languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript would be advantageous in this role, as you understand the abilities and restrictions of your designs.</p>
