							<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="cookie.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My name is Anna and I am Melbourne born and bred, but I am of Chinese heritage. Before Covid stopped the world, I was a Marketing Manager for a hospitality group, of which I really loved doing because of my passion for food and wine. With plenty of unforeseen spare time up my sleeve due to the pandemic, I have been keeping myself busy reading (definitely want to learn more about Cosmology in particular), knitting (currently attempting a sweater), going for bike rides (damn you steep inclines!) and learning the basics of HTML/CSS. <br>
									My prior studies include a Bachelor of Commerce degree, majoring in Marketing.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Interest in I.T.</h2>
									<p><h4>What is your interest in IT?</h4></p>
										<p>My interest in IT has always been innate, having expressed my creativity via website design using Microsoft Frontpage when I was a young age. I was always interested in exploring further, however I never contemplated the possibility of studying IT when I finished High School, as it wasn’t really a career presented to females. After having some time on my hands this year, I started learning HTML/CSS basics and really found myself enjoying it. This sparked an idea to take my learning to a more formal setting, which is how I got into this course. I’m very excited to see what potential this can bring, both personally and professionally!</p>
									<p><h4>Why RMIT?</h4></p>
										<p>RMIT stood out to me as an internationally renowned institute, one that would have highly capable and dedicated teaching staff. I wanted to learn from the best. As I was unsure when the lockdown restrictions would ease up for hospitality (thus, returning back to work), I decided the online avenue would be best and RMIT had the best flexibility for my lifestyle.</p>
								<p><h4>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h4></p>
									<p>I hope to take my knowledge to the next level, to expand my understanding of the industry in general. At the moment, my understanding of IT is very broad, so I would love to explore further. I also expect to be fully supported by my tutors/lecturers and fellow classmates, as an online learning environment will always present challenges. Although I am unsure whether study is 100% right for me (I haven’t studied at university level for seven years!), I am very much enjoying it at the moment.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Role</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="drew.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><b><a href="PD.pdf" target = blank>Position Description: Product Designer for ABC</a></p></b>
								<p><h4>The position and what makes this position appealing to me.</h4></p>
										<p><ul>
											<li>The position is a Product Designer (Or UX/UI Designer) for ABC Kids and Me applications. This role appeals to me due to its vast and various responsibilities, as well as being a creative position that centers around the structure and discipline of technology, whilst also working in a highly social and collaborative environment. I would enjoy all aspects of this role as it would mean being able to put on one of many ‘hats’ throughout the working week. No two days would be the same.</li>
											<li>I like that the role is both UI and UX focused, not one specifically over the other. I also would prefer to work on applications over websites, as I believe whilst applications have a smaller design space to work with, you have to be much more focused and efficient with your design. Every element needs a purpose (or three!).</li>
											<li>There is also a strong research element that requires a person who has excellent capabilities to ask the right questions, to be approachable and to draw the responses out of the audience, in a time efficient manner.</li>
											<li>The added desirability of this role is working with a nationally renowned company such as the ABC, and in particular ABC Kids. The creative design element for ABC Kids would be a lot of fun to work with!</li></p></ul>

								<p><h4>Skills, qualifications and experience required.</h4></p>
									<p>This position requires quite a substantial amount of skills and qualifications, including:<br></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Strong understanding of human centered design principles within a digital landscape.</li>
											<li>Experience in designing complex enterprise software solutions and understanding of audience experience. </li>
											<li>Graduate degree in Design Media preferred.
											<li>Knowledge of design tools such as Invision, Sketch, Git, Photoshop, and Illustrator.
											<li>Ability to think outside the box with fresh and innovative ideas. Also having a wide scope of design ability due to working on  design projects for varying audiences throughout your career.
											<li>Excellent research skills, including the ability to extract the necessary information from focus groups.
											<li>Ability to present visual and verbal ideas in a clear, concise and engaging manner, to a wide range of stakeholders. Ability to take constructive feedback and make necessary adjustments.
											<li>Excellent problem solving skills.
											<li>Ability to collaborate with multiple stakeholders of varying positions within the company.</li></p></ul>

										<p><h4>My skills, qualifications and experience.</b></h4>
											<p>My work background does cover a few of the skills required for this role. Specifically:<br></p>
											<ul>
												<li>An understanding of basic design principles, as well as proven experience working in an apparel design capacity. This includes understanding of market place, market segments and user’s needs. Strong attention to detail is required.</li>
												<li>Ability to translate data, user research and creative trend forecasts into actionable strategies and commercially viable products.</li>
												<li>Collaborating and communicating with multiple stakeholders of all levels and cross functional teams.</li>
												<li>Problem-solving skills and ability to handle pressure.</li>
												<li>Presentation skills including presenting findings, conceptual ideas, both visually and verbally. Also ability to present in an informative, inspirational and engaging manner.</li>
												<li>High written and spoken communication skills, including sound negotiation skills.</li><p></ul>

										<p><h4>How you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now?</b></h4>
												<p>	Firstly, my enrolment in RMIT’s Bachelor of IT degree will help me greatly with the technical aspects of the role, specifically the programming and user centered design courses, which is currently the pathway I am more drawn towards.</p>
													<p>I will have to personally work towards graphic design skills and understanding of role specific programs such as Figma and Sketch, which are industry standard. I believe this will require a lot of dedicated hours to this, perhaps I will take up short courses on programs such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. My current knowledge of these Adobe programs are basic, so I would really need to step it up, and get comfortable using trackpads/pens and be comfortable with my ability to hand sketch ideas for prototyping.</p>
												<p>From there, an extensive design portfolio will be required to showcase the breath of creative abilities. This will include creating a lot of varying design work, including submissions to design hackathons, personal projects and (hopefully!) commercial work too.</p>
												<p>An indepth understanding of programming languages, such as Swift (iOs), Java and Kotlin (Android), Javascript or TypeScript (hybrid development) would be ideal in this role. However, a basic understanding of frontend languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript would be advantageous in this role, as you understand the abilities and restrictions of your designs.</p>

								<h4>Overview</h4>
									<p>These tests provide me with a greater understanding of who I am and how I work. I have to say these tests, although accurate, I didn’t really give them much consideration previously. These tests have really drawn my attention and focus into my behaviours. I am now much more conscious of how I am, and how my behaviours translate to others working with and around me.</p>
									<p>The findings have been very interesting! Based on the results, I am much more aware and conscious of my behaviour. I will definitely give more consideration for others, especially if they are working in a way that doesn’t resonate with me. I hope that if I find I am not working cohesively with a team member, these results will help me actively identify which behaviour my team member is displaying, and assist me to seek out alternative ways to better communicate and influence them.</p>
									<p>When forming a team, I will actively try to make sure all team members are not sitting within the one profile. Diversity of behaviours and ways of working help encourage alternative approaches and thought processes to the assignment.</p>

								<h3>Myers-Briggs personality test</h3>
								<a href="myerbriggs.png" target=blank><img src="myerbriggs.png" ALIGN=left height=40% width=40%></a>
								<p>The Debater type personality has a few strong personality traits. Debaters are inquisitive by nature and like to look at the whole spectrum of views on an issue before settling. As well as being a quick problem solver, I will be able to bring multiple perspectives and viewpoints on a problem, and present them with relative speed. Debates are also great brainstormers, so I will be able to get the ball rolling on a group assignment task, encouraging team members to submit their thoughts.</p><p>On the other end of the scale, Debaters are viewed as insensitive due to their blunt delivery of opinion, which could be taken unwell by people who are not familiar. Although my intentions are to bring out the best in people and to assist them, this may not come across in that regard. This will definitely be one of my personality traits that I need to keep an eye on when working with teams. </p>
								<h3>Big 5 Personality Test</h3>
								<a href="big5.png" target=blank><img src="big5.png" height=100% width=100%></a>
								<p>This Big Five personality test seems a bit vague to me. Whilst I can see my score for each personality attribute, I am yet to understand what exactly they mean. For example, my Extroversion score rates higher than only 25% of the population that have taken this exact test. Is this high or not? Am I considered an extrovert? Based on the percentage above the population, I would assume not. But does that mean I am leaning far into introversion?</p>
								<p>Emotional stability rates quite high (I would assume) for me, outranking 75% of the participants. This means I will be able to bring a level temperament to the group assignment, and most likely will act as the mediator should any team members have clashes.</p>
								<p>Other than those two, the other three attributes (Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Intellect/Imagination) sit around 50%, which seems quite level. Some of these results seem to contradict the Myer-Briggs results (eg. Agreeableness at 56% vs. Assertiveness at 75%).</p>
								<h3>Learning Styles Test</h3>
								<a href="learningstyles.png" target=blank><img src="learningstyles.png" height=100% width=100%></a>
								<p>The Learning Style test was a great one to finish one. Despite being relatively even spread (which I assume is a good thing!), making me highly adaptable to different learning methods. Being primarily Activist, I could see similarities in the Myer-Briggs’ Debater profile. They both call out being open-minded, enthusiastic and flexible, as well as enjoying brainstorming, group discussions and problem setting. This would be due to wanting to understand every point of view.</p>

							<h4>Community</h4>
							<p><b>Community is a location based mobile application centered on assisting members build tight knit connections with their surrounding neighbourhoods. It is a digital hub where members have the ability to connect and share content 24/7, helping members to get to know their neighbours a little better. Ultimately, Community brings together like-minded groups and facilitates real life connections, all part of a movement to create happier, more connected neighbourhoods. From small things, big things grow.</b></p>
							<p>Inspired by Melbourne lockdown restrictions on travel limits, I was looking outside my window at the physically closest people surrounding me in their apartments, and the thought occurred to me of how little I knew about them. I began to wonder small things like what they were doing to keep busy?; what sourdough recipe they were using?; where their favourite walking trails were?; how their mental health was during this time.... With technology bringing us a multitude of advantages such as convenience and the ability to connect with almost anyone in the world, I wondered why we have become more and more disconnected with our neighbours than ever before. Do we know the people we live next to? Their names, their stories? Have we become that busy that we don’t have time to get to know the like-minded communities that live around us? Modern day technology <i>“...has disrupted our social routines, and in many cases has reduced the number of people we interact with. This makes it harder to maintain meaningful social connections, resulting in loneliness.”</i> <a href = "http://www.sciencealert.com/it-s-okay-to-feel-lonely-right-now-here-s-how-to-recognise-the-symptoms" target=blank>(reference)</a>. We are social creatures, we derive a sense of value from our relationships with others. </p>
							<p>This is especially prevalent when the pandemic has forced us indoors and away from our friends and families. This is where Community comes in, utilising the advantages of digital technology to help initiative a connection and to encourage face-to-face social interaction. I want to encourage the community spirit and social-connectedness that we have lost along the way. </p>

							<h4>Key features</h4>
							<p><h4> Location</h4> Community is a location based app that sets the catchment up to 5km. The user selects how far they want to interact. 500m? 1km? 2km? Option is yours, and this will option is made to suit users based on whether they live in low or high density areas. The location setting also assists in utilising a “neighbour” dinkus for nearby users, to perhaps then spark a conversation with your true neighbours. This dinkus would activate when members are minimum 10m away to a maximum on 1km away (depending on whether you live in a low or high density area). The idea is that a brief hello or message, however short, can lead to more meaningful convos. A check in, an “are you ok?” could change your neighbour’s day.</p>
							<h4>Sign up process</h4>
							<p>To sign up, members create an animated character of themselves that will display to other members. Members can choose how they want to be represented. Community will not utilise photos of members as I believe this makes it more casual and there will be a higher sign up rate, as well as encourage interaction, due to having the privacy of not displaying your image to the people you live around if you don’t wish to. Members can also choose a nickname to display.</p>
							<h4>Community Notice Board</h4>
							<p>Much like a Community notice board, members can post content that they find relevant here in a discussion board style thread. Content can span a wide range of content including: upcoming local events, recommendations on local cafes, local news stories, local council initiatives, suggestions on netflix series, lost/found ads, seeking tennis partners, initiating book clubs etc. This is an open discussion board area where members openly post topics they find interesting or helpful to their community. The community dictates what matters to them here. </p>
							<p>Members are also able to create private group spaces if they want a more restricted audience. The importance in this overall feature is that feelings of isolation and loneliness can be alleviated if there are offers of support, practical help and friendship around the social connections within the group.</p>
							<h4>Marketplace</h4>
							<p>There is also a marketplace functionality which provides members with the ability to sell or seek products/services/used goods. This encourages truly local expenditure, with people recently actively seeking local products and suppliers to purchase from in support of keeping our local economy strong. By asking your local community for service needs such as a plumber, hairdresser etc, you will find a potentially more competitive rate being offered due to your close proximity as well as more flexible servicing times.</p>
							<p><b>Each and every Community member will have a unique and diverse app experience, based on what issues matter to their local area.</b></p>

							<p><h4>Tools & Technologies required</p></h4>
							<ul>
								<li>In terms of software, as this application is mobile based, it will utilise the location function of users’ mobile phones. This will have to be enabled by the user who will agree to a set of terms and conditions outlining our use of their location.</li>
								<li>In addition, as the app requires information of each user upon sign up (such as name, email address, DOB, password), hardware would be required in terms of a server or database to host this client information on.</li></ul>

							<p><h4>Skills and Knowledge required</p></h4>
							<ul>
								<li>To begin with, a basic wireframe would need to be mocked up so that I can place functionalities and see where they sit on the app. An open source tool such as MIT app Inventor would be utilised for this. Once the overall design is finalised, it would move into generating a high fidelity prototype. A skilled graphic designer would be required for the high fidelity prototype, as well as for the animated user components of this application.</li>
								<li>In terms of programming, I would initially build on the iOs platform, as this is the platform I feel most familiar with, before being rolled out onto Android. In Australia, there is a relatively even split share between iOs and Android users, so the operating system I will initially proceed with will be evenly risk averse. This will require the skills of an app developer as well as a back-end web developer to create your backend infrastructure for data hosted in the cloud.</li>
								<li>The above skills won’t be difficult to find, the challenge will be finding the right person for the job at the right rate. Word of mouth recommendations would probably be best in this instance.</li></ul>

							<p><h4>Outcomes</p></h4>
							<p>Despite being more connected than ever, I want to mitigate the disconnect we currently are experiencing with our community. Users of Community will hopefully experience less feelings of social isolation and loneliness amongst their community, by helping facilitate connections to build meaningful relationships in real life.</p>
							<p>Community aims to quash feelings of embarrassment users may be feeling about their loneliness. This app can help mitigate this embarrassment for them by letting users build relationships digitally first, as real life interactions may be too intimidating for them. Members can join discussion groups and hopefully from there these groups will meet up, thus helping alleviate some of the anxiety of meeting new people.</p>
							<p>Community wants to open up the dialogue that resonates with each community so that members can feel more empowered to make positive changes in their neighbourhoods.</p>
							<p><b>Ultimately, Community wants to bring back a sense of togetherness, connection and belonging. We want users to feel more connected to those physically around them by opening up avenues that would otherwise be unavailable.</p></b>
							<p>With the collection of each user’s data, we also have a greater understanding of the demographic around each area. This data in turn can be used in other helpful ways such as sensis reports, and from a monetary perspective, this app has the ability for highly targeted marketing.</p>
